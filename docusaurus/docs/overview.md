## About Beta Testing

Beta testing of the sikobaPay app started in early April 2020. It was interrupted briefly because of technical problems and resumed on 12th May for Android and on 17th May for iOS. Obviously, testing sikobaPay only makes sense if you know other users, so please make sure to invite people you know. You can also join the betatesters [Telegram channel](https://t.me/sikobaPay_BETATESTERS) where you can find other users to connect with.

Note that any transactions done during beta testing may be deleted from the system at some stage in the future.

## How Beta Testing Works

**Android** users can find the sikobaPay app on Google Play.

**iOS** users can self-enroll for beta testing via [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/QHSIF1HF) (you may need to install the TestFlight app first).

1. Send an email to betatesters@sikoba.com - you will receive a beta key in return.
2. Download the app and create your account - you will register using your mobile phone number.
3. Create connections and credit lines - connect with your business partners and friends, grant credit lines,
decide who can use your credit lines.
4. Test the app - pay or request payments, watch as credits and debits are cleared automatically.
5. Send us a feedback - we are aware that the app is still far from perfect, so any feedback is very welcome!

Our main Telegram channel is [https://t.me/sikobaNetwork](https://t.me/sikobaNetwork).

## Rewards

Beta testers who will provide us with some useful feedback, as well as those who help to improve our user documentation, will receive the rewards.

We will also reward people for helping us with the translation of the app interface. If you are eager to help, get in touch with our admins on the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/sikobaNetwork).
