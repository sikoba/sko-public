When a user settles an IOU that **they have paid you**:

- Select the IOU on either in the balance screen or in the credit line details screen. This will open the detailed view of IOUs.

Then you can choose:

- [Full Settle](full-iou-settlement.md) to fully settle the IOU
- [Partial Settle](partial-iou-settlement.md) to settle just a part of the IOU. The remainder of the IOUâ€™s total amount and the provided amount will be represented by a new IOU
