## How Beta Testing Works

1. Send an email to betatesters@sikoba.com - you will receive a beta key in return.
2. [Open the app]() and [create your account](sign-up.md) - you will register using your mobile phone number.
3. [Create connections](add-new-connection.md) and [credit lines](add-new-credit-line.md) - connect with your business partners and friends, grant credit lines,
decide who can use your credit lines.
4. Test the app - [make payments](make-payment.md), watch as credits and debits are cleared automatically.
5. Send us feedback - we are aware that the app is still far from perfect, so any feedback is very welcome! Add your comments/feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1GlLayWrfCgDMhhaJDYvfQgqExMekCaLeluI8udjhE/edit#heading=h.t1z67zjewsrt) or send an email to **feedback@sikoba.com**.
