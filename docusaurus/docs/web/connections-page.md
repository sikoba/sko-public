## Connections page

<img src="../assets/web/connections1.JPG" alt="connections page image" />

This screen shows you all of your **connections** and their **status**, which can be:

- **Pending** - A connection that needs to be accepted by one user
- **Active** - A connection that has been accepted by both users
- **Inactive** - A connection that has been rejected by one user
- **Cancelled** - A connection that has been cancelled by one user

## Pending connections

By clicking on a *Pending* connection, you'll see the options where you can choose to:

- **Accept** - accept requested connection.
- **Reject** - When a connection is rejected, it prevents the sender of the request from sending additional connection requests to that user-- think of it as spam prevention. It can be reactivated by the rejecting user.
