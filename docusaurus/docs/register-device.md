- then you'll see an info screen that this device is not registered. You can register the device by choosing one of the options:
  - using another **registered** device - tap on the *Device* option
  - or using your [master key](vocabulary.md#master-key) - tap on the *Master key* option

**NOTE**: you can [de-register](de-register-device.md) any of your devices at any time.

## Register with another registered device

If you choose to register your new device with another registered device, the app will generate a QR-code that you should scan with one of your registered devices.

To scan this QR-code:

- open sikobaPay app on your registered device and tap on the QR code icon <img src="assets/qr-code.png" alt="qr-code icon" width="20" style="margin-bottom: -3px; background: black; "/> in bottom right corner of the [Balance screen](home.md).

**IMPORTANT**: you should be logged in under the same credentials on both devices: the one that you are using as a registered device and the second that you'd like to register.

Now you can log in on your new device and use the app.

## Register with your master key

If you choose to register your new device with the master key, then you'll be prompted to enter your master key (12 words) that was generated during [sign up](sign-up.md) process.

Enter each word of your master key in a respective field and press *Done* button.
