To read any QR code generated by the sikobaPay application, you need to click on the QR code icon in the bottom right corner, grant camera permissions and then scan the QR code.

The app will automatically detect what action you are attempting to trigger based on the QR code that you scanned.

There are several actions that can be represented by QR code:

1. [Request payment](request-payment.md)
2. Find connection
3. Find credit line
4. Find IOU
5. Find user
