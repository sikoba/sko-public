To read any QR code generated by the sikobaPay application, you need to click on the QR code icon <img src="assets/qr-code.png" alt="qr-code icon" width="20" style="margin-bottom: -3px; background: black; display: inline;"/> in the bottom right corner of the [Balance screen](home.md), grant camera permissions and then scan the QR code.

The app will automatically detect what action you are attempting to trigger based on the QR code that you scanned.

There are several actions that can be represented by QR code:

1. [Request payment](request-payment.md)
2. [Find connection](find-connection.md)
3. [Find credit line](find-credit-line.md)
4. [Find IOU](find-iou.md)
5. [Find user](find-user.md)
