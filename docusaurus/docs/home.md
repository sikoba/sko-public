## Balance

Your balance is the total of the IOUs you have paid and the IOUs people have paid you in each currency.
By tapping the balance amount at the top of the screen, you can scroll down and see your balance for all of the currencies you are using.

SKS tokens are needed for any actions you take. For more details on SKS, check out the token section.

## Next settlements
