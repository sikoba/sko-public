This screen shows you all of your **connections** and their **status**, which can be:

- **Pending** - A connection that needs to be accepted by one user
- **Active** - A connection that has been accepted by both users
- **Inactive** - A connection that has been rejected by one user
- **Cancelled** - A connection that has been cancelled by one user

You can also:

- [Add a new connection](add-new-connection.md) by pressing on <img src="assets/plus-icon.png" alt="plus icon" width="25" style="margin-bottom: -7px"/> button
- [Open the menu](menu.md) by clicking on the Menu <img src="assets/menu-icon.png" alt="menu icon" width="25" style="margin-bottom: -7px"/> icon

By clicking on a *Pending* connection you are taken to a screen where you can choose to:

- **Accept** - accept requested connection.
- **Reject** - When a connection is rejected, it prevents the sender of the request from sending additional connection requests to that user-- think of it as spam prevention. It can be reactivated by the rejecting user.
