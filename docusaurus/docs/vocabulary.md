## IOU payment

A promise of delayed payment; an IOU of 50 EUR at 30 days means that the debtor will pay the amount thirty days later from the moment of transacting

## Connection

A connection is a relation between two users; it can be sent from one user and answered by another user; once accepted, the uses are connected and they can grant each other credit lines

## Credit line

A credit line is a relation of trust from one user to another; it means that the user who sent the credit line offer(creditor), trusts the other user(debtor) for IOU payments

## (Credit) conversion

A credit conversion occurs when one user allows another to use his/her credit line to transact with all or part of his/her network. For example, A wants to buy something from C, but C does not trust A. If C trusts B, and B trusts A, and B enables credit conversion for C, then A can transact with C. As a result, A will owe B, and B will owe C.
