## IOU payment

A promise of delayed payment; an IOU of 50 EUR at 30 days means that the debtor will pay the amount thirty days later from the moment of transacting

## Connection

A connection is a relation between two users; it can be sent from one user and answered by another user; once accepted, the uses are connected and they can grant each other credit lines

## Credit line

A credit line is a relation of trust from one user to another; it means that the user who sent the credit line offer(creditor), trusts the other user(debtor) for IOU payments

## (Credit) conversion

This is when one user allows another to use his credit line towards another. For example: A wants to buy something from C, but C does not trust A. If C trusts B, and B trusts A, and B allows for credit conversion, the A can buy from C. The result is that A will owe B, and B will owe C.

## Conversion profile

Default settings for conversion for a credit line; has a global max. and a single max -- see below

## Global conversion max

Determines the maximum amount of conversion credit that can be used on the credit line at any given moment

## Single conversion max

Default value to be granted to conversion permits; this value can be overridden

## Conversion permit

Allows a user to use another credit line for payments that has not been granted to him directly; granter grants a permit to a grantee, for a given max. amount and potential additional fee

## Conversion fee

Describes the extra fee that a granter of a permit can impose on all payments created with the permit that he grants

## Clearing flexibility

This is about offsetting IOUs that have different payment target dates. The higher the flexibility, the larger the difference (in days) of two such IOUs can be.

## Master key

It is a cryptographic key for protection of other keys.
