**Sikoba tokens (“SKO”)** will represent an electronic form of value that will be used to indirectly pay for commissions on the Sikoba network.  There will actually be two types of tokens: SKO and SKS.

## SKO

**SKO** is the main Sikoba network token, and this is the token being sold to fund network development. The price of SKO will eventually fluctuate based on supply and demand.

Currently, there is no active market for this token, and we only have a record of token sales at (so far) steadily increasing prices. Once the mainnet is launched, a market for SKO tokens will be organized and the SKO price should be influenced by the actual growth of the Sikoba network as measured, for example, by transaction volume.

## SKS

**SKS** is the internal Sikoba Gas token. All transaction fees on the SikobaPay network will be expressed in SKS.

At the launch of mainnet, the price of SKS will be fixed against fiat at a level that is expected to make the system profitable for blockchain node operators—this is essential for the stability and security of the network.

The goal is for SKS to track cloud computing and storage costs. This will make transaction costs stable and predictable over the long term, thus completely avoiding the large variations in transaction costs observed on blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

SKS can be purchased using SKO using an internal market-maker. It will also be possible to exchange SKS back into SKO, but this will be subject to a conversion penalty.

## Summary

SKO are tokens whose value will fluctuate, while SKS tokens have a stable value.

A user holding SKO will not be sure how many transactions she will be able to make in the future but may hope to see a price appreciation.

A user holding SKS cannot hope for a price appreciation but will know exactly how many transactions she will be able to make in the future.
