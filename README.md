# sko-public

This repository contains the public components of the SikobaPay project, which is being developed by [www.sikoba.com](http://www.sikoba.com).

Currently (August 2020), we have the internationalization files open to the public, as well as the Babble-sikobaPay demo that we are preparing, as part of our task of putting sikobaPay on a blockchain.

Of course, we expect to move other parts of the code to this public repository in the future.
